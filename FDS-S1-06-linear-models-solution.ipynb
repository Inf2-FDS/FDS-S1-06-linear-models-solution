    "Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels in the body. In people with diabetes, the body does not produce enough insulin or doesn't respond to it normally, so glucose levels can become dangerously high. Some people with certain types of diabetes prevent their glucose levels becoming too high by injecting themselves with insulin. The first question we are going to try to answer is:\n",

In this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897752/), researchers tried to understand the effects of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and anatomical site on skin thickness. Being able to predict the skin thickness helps to find the optimal site for subcutaneous injections. We will try to answer this question using the diabetes data set from the S1 Week 4 Lab.\n",
